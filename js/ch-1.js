/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height).
(mass in kg and height in meter).
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a
higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something
    like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
