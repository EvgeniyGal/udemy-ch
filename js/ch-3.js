/** ***************************
* CODING CHALLENGE 3
*/

/*
John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants.
 The bills were $124, $48 and $268.
To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator
(as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than
$50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than
$200.
In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).
(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
